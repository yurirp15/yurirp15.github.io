## Introduction
Hi everyone!

I created this site to share my programming learnings, so today was a day where I was able to learn the Hugo framework, which I applied to this blog with the help of the PaperMod theme.

The idea was to do something simple where I could write my learnings in English and bring programming curiosities, and be able to practice the English language :)

Thanks for visiting o/
